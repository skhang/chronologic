ChronoLogic is an intelligent daily scheduling app for Android. Paper day planners require that every activity, errand, etc., be given a specific time and duration. This requires too many decisions and is not robust. You know you need to buy groceries sometime before Friday, but this doesn't mean you know when before Friday will be a good time, nor should you have to choose. Likewise, a small schedule alteration can result in significant changes, which are difficult to reschedule with pen and paper. Most electronic calenders follow the pen and paper model, doing little more than enabling easier rescheduling and conflict notification.

ChronoLogic is different. You need only supply as much information as you have about an activity, and ChronoLogic handles the rest. Do you have a one hour meeting at 11:30 am? Great! ChronoLogic can handle that (and so can everything else). Do you need to write a letter, but don't know when? Don't worry, ChonoLogic will find a good time for you! Do you need to practice saxophone at least 9.5 hours a week, starting no earlier than 7 am and ending no later than 9 pm, and with every session longer than 1 hour but always less than 3 hours? Awesome! ChronoLogic will schedule your practice sessions around your other appointments and errands for you! And, if you miss or add an appointment, ChonoLogic will intelligently adjust your schedule and let you know if something just won't happen.
